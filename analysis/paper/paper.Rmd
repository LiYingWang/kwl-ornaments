# Introduction

The direct impacts of European colonialism on indigenous communities in East Asia were much less pronounced than island Southeast Asia and Oceania. Throughout East Asia direct colonial rule was rare and limited, but the question of long-lasting indirect impacts on local indigenous communities remains largely unanswered. Understanding the indirect effects of colonialism are important for detecting colonial impacts on indigenous peoples in the periphery of colonial control [@TorrenceandClarke2000; @Trabert2017]. In many parts of the world, the introduction of foreign trade goods by colonial traders into local indigenous societies caused significant transformations of indigenous economic, cultural, and socio-political systems [@Dietler1997; @Junker1993; @Mitchell2000; @Silliman2005]. The agency of indigenous peoples in the colonial contexts has been broadly discussed to understand the negotiations between colonized and colonizer, and the resistance and accommodations of indigenous people through their daily cultural practices [@Dietler2015; @Given2004; @Rubertone2000; @Silliman2001; @Torrence2000; @TorrenceandClarke2000; @Voss2005]. Studying the consumption of foreign goods is one way to understand indigenous experiences of colonial encounters and explore the agency of indigenous peoples by examining how goods were distributed and used [@Dietler2005; @Mullins2011; @Scaramelli2005].

Taiwan provides an ideal case study of indirect effects of colonialism because it has archaeological evidence spanning its initial involvement in regional exchange networks of East Asia and Southeast Asia since the \tenth century. It became part of global trade systems during the early 17th century due to western European expansions that connected Europe and Asia [@Liu2017]. Despite colonization of Taiwan by the Spanish and Dutch from 1624 to 1662, there has been little discussion of the archaeology of indigenous responses to the European colonization. @Berrocal2018 study \the long-term record of Heping Dao\ in northern Taiwan and explore the effects of European colonization on the local populations by focusing on the environmental change and introduction of diseases, with a little mention of indigenous social complexity. Yilan in Northeastern Taiwan is an especially unique location for exploring indirect effects due to its physically isolated location. The rugged Hsuehshan Range to the west and Central Range to the south of the Yilan Plain that made it not easily accessible to the European colonists and the colonial control was weaker compared to other parts of this region [@Andrade2007; @Kang2012]. The sea provides a way through which indigenous people in Yilan could interact with other groups from different regions, including other native Indigenous groups, foreign traders such as the Han people of China, and Europeans. Large-scale and frequent trade activities brought a wide variety of trade objects into Indigenous communities in Yilan through local regional exchange network. One of the most common types of trade goods in this region were personal ornaments such as glass and stone beads was one of the common foreign goods found at the settlement sites in this region [@Chen2007; @Li2014; @NMTH2005]. Personal adornments are a social signal of an individual’s status [@Joyce2005; @Scaramelli2005]. For example, the consumption of stone beads in Southeast Asia during Iron Age is often associated with increasing social stratification or socio-political complexity [@Bellina2014; @Carter2016; @Francis2002; @Theunissen2000; @Kenoyer2000]. 

In this paper, I explore the evidence from Yilan spanning from late Iron Age to historical period to address the question of whether indirect colonial influences on Indigenous populations can be detected. I focus on  the ornaments recovered from the archaeological excavations at Kiwulan (1400-1900 AD), a large Iron Age settlement in northeastern Taiwan [@Chen2007]. Prior to the contact with the Europeans in the early 17th century, northern Taiwan had been involved in both regional and long-distance East and Southeast Asian trade systems, and encountered \several waves of Han Chinese migration in the 19th century [@Chen2005]. Northeastern Taiwan provides a good example to explore the indirect colonial impacts on Indigenous societies by comparing archaeological evidence from different episodes of culture contact [cf.@Lape2003]. I will describe the variety and cultural context of trade ornaments in this region, and examine their potential of the ornaments to inform on social changes relating to trade with colonial groups. I hypothesize that there was a greater diversity of ornaments types and materials at Kiwulan after European contact due to participation in a larger scale exchange network. I also predict that after European contact there will be new spatial patterns in the distributions of ornaments at Kiwulan that indicates increasing social inequality. I hypothesize that after Chinese contact there was a decline in the production, use and discard of ornaments at Kiwulan due to overall population declines and acculturation\.

# Cultural context of ornaments in Yilan, northeastern Taiwan 

Prior to European colonization, the Indigenous people in northern Taiwan had already established their own exchange network that has been described as “inter-insular trade” by Chen @Chen2005 [pp. 12] to refer to small-scale regional trade between China and Taiwan on irregular basis. This local exchange network of northeastern Taiwan was increasingly influenced by long distance trade between Fuzhou or Quanzhou in China and Ryukyu in Japan since 15th century due to its location on the shipping routes. This was intensified in the 17th century with the arrival of the Europeans and their trade goods [@Chen2005; @Liu2017; @Wang2007]. Due to its location on the periphery of major trade ports, \Keelung and \Tamsui, in northern Taiwan, Yilan was involved in this network through the periodic exchange activities between different indigenous groups. Yilan, also called "Kavalan" by local indigenous people, is an alluvial plain circumscribed by the Pacific and mountains on the sides. Rivers and seas provide the way for the interaction between local indigenous settlements and further afield communities, such as the Basai in northern Taiwan and Han Chinese. Kavalan people offered rice, deer hides, and gold in exchange for beads, metal tools or ornaments, ironwares, porcelains, and textiles with outside traders [@Chen2005; @Hsieh2009; @LiandWu2006]. 

Historical documents from the Spanish and Dutch in the early 17th century provide some information about the social life and culture of indigenous people in Northern Taiwan when the Europeans arrived. The Spanish founded Fort San Salvador at Keelung in 1626 and Fort San Domingo in 1629 at Tamsui, and sent missionaries to local indigenous settlements in this region for religious purpose [@Blusse2000, pp. 343]. The report of the Dominican priest Fr. Jacinto Esquivel in 1632 mentioned that the Taparri, an indigenous tribe from northern Taiwan, usually used cuentas (agate beads) in exchange for necessities with other indigenous groups. This form of exchange was widespread and even the Spanish soldiers learned to use agate as bargaining chips for gambling [@LiandWu2006, pp. 132-149]. Esquivel also recorded how indigenous people viewed agate pieces as prestige goods in their culture. A indigenous man who wanted to get married had to pay agate beads to the parents of his future wife. Also, agate or golden beads could be used as to resolve conflicts in their daily lives [@LiandWu2006, pp. 151]. Other records mention that the female shamans (majuorbol) in the tribe would use agate beads as magical items in ritual practice for body healing[@Borao2009, pp. 122-151]. An indigenous funeral process was recorded, documenting the use of agate beads in ritual contexts, with more agate beads, pottery and cloths placed into the graves of more influential people to indicate a family’s higher prestige [@LiandWu2006, pp. 153]. Those historical accounts indicate that agate beads or golden beads were already treated as prestige goods before the arrival of the Europeans. These were likely introduced earlier from Chinese traders.

In 1642, the Dutch VOC defeated the Spanish and took over their forts in northern Taiwan. They introduced a feudal system in an attempt to control the indigenous communities by asking indigenous leaders to attend annual ceremony for demonstrate their loyalty [@Andrade2007, ch. 9; @Kang2016, ch. 4]. The Dutch provided beads and other goods based on the demands of Indigenous people to secure alliances in the annual ceremony or during traveling [@Kang2016, ch. 6]. Thus, I assume that the Dutch feudal system resulted in an increase in the amount and diversity of ornaments in northeastern indigenous communities during this period.

Chinese historical records from the year of 1829, 1837, and 1852 during the Qing dynasty [1616-1911] contain some notes on the purposes of ornaments from Yilan [@Chen1963, pp. 228, 308; @Ke1993, pp. 11, 126; @Yao1996, pp. 77]. According to those records, indigenous people in Yilan had a custom to wear ornaments in ceremonial contexts to display their wealth and status. Among those ornaments, golden fish-shaped necklaces made of copper threads had higher value due to its delicacy and more materials invested in production. These were usually possessed by wealthy people. Other people wore agate beads or glass beads on their head or neck to participate in ceremonies. In 1895, at the beginning of Japanese colonization, @Ino2002 conducted a field survey for several Indigenous groups and found that golden necklaces were not used in Yilan at that time, but elderly people still used beads.

Recent ethnographic research with the living members of the Kavalan tribe describes how agate beads were used in divination practices, called “subli”, by female shamans [@Liu2008, pp. 133-134]. Interview records mention agate beads as valuable objects that are usually passed down from mother to daughter as a heirlooms in shaman families, without knowing the exact origin. When not in use, beads were often hidden in safe places, such as on the roof beams. Modern ethnographic research shows that agate beads were not only used as decoration, but also played an important role in divination, consistent with observations from the European colonial period. It was usually the female shamans conducting divination rituals that passed the beads down from their ancestors. Despite most Kavalan  people today not knowing the specific origin of their agate beads, the value of beads is still highlighted through oral history and by their scarcity. In sum, we find multiple sources describing how local Indigenous people used ornaments in cultural contexts that represents some social roles or high status. However, compared to European contact period, there are fewer mentions of beads in Chinese contact period and the descriptions are limited to clothing, but generally confirm the role of beads as status markers. 

# Excavations at Kiwulan in northeastern Taiwan

```

Kiwulan \@ref(fig:KWL-map) is located at northern Yilan and was a rescue archaeology projects that carried out from 2001 to 2004 in advance of water diversion project and construction of a road bridge. The total area includes eight open area sections of 262 squares (4 m by 4 m) reaching 3,814 m2 in total [@Chen2007]. The archaeological evidence includes a large amount of artifacts, burials, middens, post holes, wooden pillars, and stone structures, all of which indicates it was a settlement. Most ornaments were found in situ while digging and some were collected through screens with 2 mm and 1.5 mm mesh. The ornaments studied in this paper were found from 40 adjacent squares in the largest open area, located in the middle part of excavation (\Figure 2). They were sampled because those units were stratigraphically intact with the least disturbance by modern construction activity, compared to excavation squares on the periphery of the site. 

The chronology of Kiwulan can be divided into two phases represented by a Lower Layer Culture (700 - 1200 AD) and a Upper Layer Culture (1400 - 1900 AD) with a sterile layer in between. This chronology is based on the stratigraphy and a series of 32 radiocarbon dates [@Chen2007]. This paper focuses on the Upper Layer Culture spanning from the late Iron Age, and historical period starting from the 17th century with European contact in Taiwan.

Previous researchers divided the Upper Layer Culture component into six layers spanning from the 14th century to the 19th century with a hundred year intervals according to original radiocarbon dates, excavation depth, and types of diagnostic porcelains [@Hsieh2009; @Wang2011]. The layers were assigned numbers from 1 to 6 where L1 corresponds to the youngest layer and L6, the bottom layer, refers to the oldest layer. However, because the specific methods of assigning layers to a time period was not documented in detail for the previous chronology, I reexamined the excavation records to produce a new chronology for the sampled squares. For each sampled square I separated excavation units into three episodes of time: pre-European contact period (L5, L6), European contact period (L4), and Chinese contact period (L2 and L1).

I identify the start of European contact at Kiwulan at 1632, when the local villages were attacked by the Spanish who took revenge on an incident happened earlier that year [@Borao2001, pp. 163]. Later in 1647, the Dutch attacked the indigenous villages and forced them to accept colonial rules and economic demands by paying annual tribute [@Andrade2007]. According to Dutch census reports in 1650, Kiwulan was the largest indigenous settlement in the Yilan Plain, with a population of 840 adults [@Nakamura1938, pp. 12]. The start of European contact in Kiwalan is indicated in the archaeological record by the presence of An-ping jars, stonewares that were largely introduced to Taiwan during the early 17th century. I used the presence and absence of An-ping jars, together with the radiocarbon dates, to identify excavation units associated with the pre-European and post-European periods. European colonization ended in 1662 when they were defeated by the kingdom of Tungning found by Koxinga from China. Later in 1683, the Qing dynasty ruled over Taiwan and a large wave of Han Chinese migrated to Yilan during the late 18th century. I recongnise this as the Chinese colonization period, which is archaeological visible at Kiwulan by \Chinese porcelains and bricks that brought by Chinsese communities [@Hsieh2009]. Also, the description of Chinese migration can be identified from Chinese official records [@Chen1963].

# The ornaments

In general, complete ornaments with clear context were mostly found in burials that helps to understand how people wear them. In addition to burials, large amount of ornaments were found at household area that were identified by a series of post holes across the space. Here I focus on the ornaments found at post-hole area considering the overall quantity and the comparison across the space. Ornaments were made from a wide variety of raw materials, in which glass, agate and copper are the common materials that were thought to be introduced through trading with the Europeans and Chinese traders since no clear evidence of waste by-products in the archaeological record [@Chen2007]. Although a possibility of small workshops that individuals were able to produce golden beads from prepared glass materials by heating [@Cheng2008], no evidence of accompanying tools or materials in proportion to the large amount of golden beads were found. The shape of ornaments include beads, bracelets, rings, bells, pendants, and knitted objects. It shows that the shape is closely related to what kind of raw material it was made from. For example, beads were only made of glass and agate, while copper ornaments were in the form such as bells, bracelets, and rings [@Chen2007].

Ornaments from the post-hole area accounts for the \majority of the amount in total.

For the post-hole area, there were `r sample_size` ornaments recovered from the 40 sampling squares, which accounts \for `r sample_pro` % of the total number of ornaments found in the same open area section. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-all-ornaments-count) shows that the most common ornament is golden bead with the number of 143, followed by 121 glass beads, 46 agate beads, 35 metal rings, and 22 metal bells. The variety of subtype and their individual frequency are summarized in \@ref(tab:tidy-data-for-table) in terms of three time episodes. The image for each subtype in each major category is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ornaments-image).

# Results of hypothesis testing

In this section I report the tests of the three hypotheses about indirect impacts of European colonization on the Indigenous community at Kiwulan. To test the hypothesis of a greater diversity of ornaments types and materials at Kiwulan after European contact, and a lesser diversity after Chinese contact, I compare frequencies of ornament types between different time periods. To test the prediction that after European contact were new spatial patterns in the distributions of ornaments at Kiwulan, I use kernel density and point pattern analyses. 

## Frequency of ornaments between time periods
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-counts-by-period) shows the comparison of ornament type frequencies between different time periods at Kiwulan. It indicates a general pattern that most ornament types were present before European contact. The frequencies reached a peak during the European contact and then dropped during the Chinese contact period, especially for golden beads. This trend can be also seen on other ornaments including agate bead, metal ring, and bell. However, glass beads show a different pattern that indicates a higher frequency in the pre-European contact, and then their frequency decreased in the European contact period and was even much less in the Chinese contact period.

The distribution of frequency for subtypes in each major category are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-altogether). The distribution shows that agate beads and metal rings have greater quantity and \variety of shapes compared to copper bell and glass beads during the European contact period. Agate beads can be divided into seven subtypes, in which hexagonal shape is the most common subtype that appeared before European contact and increased significantly during the European contact and then declined in the Chinese contact. The small oval type shows a similar frequency before and during European contact but is not found in the Chinese contact period. Waxy oval beads were only found during European contact period. A higher variety of agate beads were found in European contact compared to other time periods. Similarly, metal rings can be classified into eight subtypes, in which wide small ring is the most common metal ornaments, followed by wide large and thin large shape. The greater varieties for those two categories might indicate multiple origins due to global trade networks stimulated by the Europeans. In contrast, copper bell and glass bead have less variety, but glass beads have a larger number because they were usually found in a cluster that indicates the original use as strings or necklaces. The common shape for copper bells is the large shape with a wide variety of human faces as a motif, while the common shape for glass beads is a bead with length less than 1 cm that are often identified as Indo-Pacific beads, the most common type that had been widespread in Southeast Asian sites since 300 BC [@Francis2002].

<---I think we need an addition bit of analysis in this section to show the relationship between diversity and sample size. We naturally expect diversity to increase as sample size increases. So we want to test and see if the changes in diversity that you describe here are only the natural effects of increase/decrease in sample size, or there are ‘real’ increases in diversity that cannot be explained by sample size changes. The peer reviewers will want to know the answers to this. --->

## Spatial distribution of ornament types 

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-spatial-pattern-each) presents the spatial distribution of the main ornament types for each time period. Before the European contact, the map shows a greater amount of glass beads found at the northern and middle parts of the research area, and they were more widespread during the European contact period. During the European contact period, ornaments were more ubiquitous with some clusters on northern part, and less abundance during the Chinese contact period. When looking at the distribution for each major class individually, some clusters across the area can be observed during European contact, including golden beads, agate beads, metal rings, and bells. However, there seems to be no clear consistent clustered pattern across those different ornaments. Each class shows its own pattern where the squares with higher number of ornaments distributed separately and independently. For example, the cluster of golden beads was found at the northern part, while the cluster of agate beads was found in the middle part. In contrast, there are multiple clusters of metal rings that are distributed separately across the research area. Copper bells were usually found individually and seem randomly distributed across the area. In the Chinese Contact period, both the amount and density of different classes of ornaments decreased that they were only found in a few squares, for example, golden beads and glass beads were only found in a few squares in the middle part.

## Point pattern analysis of ornament distribution 
I used point pattern analysis  to examine whether the distribution of ornaments was uneven in non-random ways that could reflect the presence of social inequality. Point pattern analysis is a way to assess whether the distribution of sites or artifacts represent some “hotspots” produced by non-random processes, implying the influence of social processes [@Bevan2016; @Ducke2015]. ). In this case hotspots in the pattern of ornaments could indicate the changes in social organization due to culture contact. I used the intensity approach that focuses on the average density of points across space to explore their distribution. Ornament location points were given random coordinates within each square they they were recovered from because their exact recovery location in each square was not recorded excavation. The next step was to subset the orgaments into three groups for three time periods, and then compute the kernel density for each time period for comparison. 
Kernel density estimations (KDE) estimate the probability of the density of events across space by creating a continuous, smooth density surface across space. Here we use KDE to visualize the event of the presence of ornaments that were represented by maps on which we are able to see core areas and surrounding neighborhoods [@Bonnier2019; @Cortegoso2016]. Density values of artefacts per square meter are assigned to each cell. The results in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-all-densities) show that there is one major core area during the pre-European contact period, multiple core areas during European contact period, and a single core during the Chinese contact period. Those maps present three consistent sub-regions with a core area that shifts over time. The distribution might indicate different social groups who possessed more ornaments. The multiple groups during European contact period might reflect more unequal consumption of ornaments across the site, relative to other periods. However, the generation of core areas might be biased due to small sample size, for example, a few ornaments found at one single square during the Chinese period could create an obvious hot spot. To further evaluate the pattern, we test the hypothesis that the distribution of ornaments is randomly distributed to understand the underlying social processes related to ornament distributions.

```{r}
# function for hypothesis testing
nndist_hypo_testing <- function(x, n = 1e3L,  ... ) {
  
ann_tmp <- mean(nndist(x$ornaments_point_ppp, k = 1))

# object for storing simulated ANN values
ann_r_tmp <- vector(length = n) 

for (i in 1:n) {
  # Generate random point locations
  rand_tmp <-  rpoint(n = x$ornaments_point_ppp$n,
                      win = as.owin(as_Spatial(sample_units)))
  ann_r_tmp[i] <-
    mean(nndist(rand_tmp, k = 1))  # Tally the ANN values
}  

the_plot <- 
hist(
  ann_r_tmp,
  xlab = NULL,
  las = 1,
  breaks = 40,
  col = "bisque",
  xlim = range(ann_tmp, ann_r_tmp),
  ...)

abline(v = ann_tmp, col = "blue")

return(the_plot)
}
```

```{r hypo-test-distrubution, fig.cap= "Histogram of simulated ANN values with the blue line indicating the observed value"}

# make the blue lines thicker to be more visible
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
invisible(
map2(kernels_for_plotting, 
    titles,
    ~invisible(nndist_hypo_testing(.x, 
                         main = .y)))
)
```

Here we use a Monte Carlo method to test the spatial randomness of spatial events based on the average nearest-neighbor distance method (ANN). Our null hypothesis is that the distribution of ornaments is consistent with a completely random process, so we then simulate the locations of ornaments across the space 1000 times for each time period. The observed data was compared to the random pattern generated by simulated processes to see if our data is randomly distributed or not. Figure \@ref(fig:hypo-test-distrubution) shows the distributions of the ANN distances calculated on 1000 simulations of ornament locations. The results show that 100% of the simulated values are much more greater than our observed ANN value during the European contact period, which means the ornaments have a non-random clustered distributions. A similar, but less extreme, result is also observed during the pre-European period. The observed distribution of ornaments is more similar to the random distributions during the Chinese contact period, with about one third of the simulated values are greater than our observed ANN value. This testing reveals that the clustered distributions of ornaments during the pre-European and European contact periods might reflect the presence of different social groups. Moreover, the clustering of ornaments during the European contact period is highly non-random, potentially indicate some social changes leasing to a concentration of power to control the distribution of ornaments at Kiwulan.

# Discussion 
<--I think you have space for a short paragraph here on  network/corporate model at the end> 

The results show there was a greater diversity of ornaments types and materials at Kiwulan during European contact. This might result from the large scale exchange network that stimulated the circulation of different ornament classes. Among those ornaments, agate beads and metal rings have greater quantity and variety of shapes compared to copper bell and glass beads, which might indicate their diverse origins. However, the frequency of overall ornaments and each subtype declines significantly during the Chinese contact period. The reason could be related to smaller scale of network and the \overall \decline of Kiwulan population at that time. 

<----Why did it decline? What is the evidence for this? A few more sentences are needed on this-->

The spatial pattern of ornaments shows that their distribution was clustered since the pre-European and European contact period. Hypothesis testing for spatial patterns further indicates that these clusters are non-random, and are concentrated during European contact. Because trade ornaments were prestige goods in prehistoric Northeastern Taiwan, this spatial clustering could indicate that a degree of social inequality were present before European contact and then it was reinforced and amplified during the European contact period. 

# Conclusion

Examination of the indirect influence of colonialism can reveal how peripheral areas were influenced by the colonial activities or involved in the colonial economy centered in the major European colonies [@Trabert2017]. Kiwulan in Northeastern Taiwan is an especially important case study as an East Asian location that was relatively isolated and peripheral, and yet connected by tea to regional and global trade networks. Kiwulan can provide valuable insights into the discussion of the influence of indirect colonial contacts. In northeast Taiwan foreign trade ornaments were viewed as prestige goods and played an important social role in divination and funeral rituals. As a marker for status, the frequency and spatial distribution of body ornaments at Kiwulan present three distinct patterns during different culture contact periods. The greater amount and diversity of ornament types during the European contact period reflects international exchange in a colonial context. Those ornaments may carry an exotic and powerful image that signals wealth and trading connections to the inhabitants of Kiwulan. These symbolic values may have stimulated more competitions between aggrandizing individuals for prestige and wealth accumulation at Kiwulan, which might result in a increase in social inequality. 

This study demonstrates that foreign ornaments could be a proxy to detect the indirect colonial influence on local indigenous populations. Ornaments can give insights into the amplification of social inequality stimulated by the European colonization. It also shows the agency of indigenous people to incorporate and recontextualize the ornaments into their culture system. During the Chinese contact period, the decreasing frequency and diversity of ornaments showing a decline in the production, use and discard of ornaments at Kiwulan, which might be related to the smaller scale of exchange network with limited sources of ornaments or the overall decline of Kiwulan population. Future work could extent this approach to studies of other trade goods such as ceramics. Future directions for understanding the dynamics of social inequality at Kiwulan could include analysis of pottery production and standisation, and mortuary practices.
