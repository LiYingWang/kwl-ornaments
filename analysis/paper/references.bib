Dr. Given uses the archaeological evidence to create a vivid picture of how the lives and identities of farmers, artisans and labourers were affected by colonial systems of oppressive taxation, bureaucracy, forced labour and ideological control.".

 abstract = {The Maenam Noi kilns are situated alongside the river by that name, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, in Singburi province, Bang Rachan district. The river system connected the kilns to the capital city and international trading port of Ayutthaya. From the 15th through 17th centuries, these kilns provided the huge quantities of storage jars in various standard shapes and sizes used to ship all manner of commercial goods from the port into the world. Evidence for the production, use (and reuse) of Maenam Noi jars is particularly rich. Several kilns have been excavated and are among the largest kiln structures known in Southeast Asia. Jars are found on shipwrecks spanning the Cape of Good Hope to the coast of Vietnam, and a wreck recently recovered from Cambodian waters holds a virtual inventory of wares from the kiln. In Japan, finds of the jars in the deep and well dated archaeological site of the port city of Sakai have provided evidence for a chronology of jar shapes. Finally, the many roles assumed by the jars within cultures that received them range from storage containers for sulfur (an ingredient of gunpowder) in Sakai to secondary burial vessels in upland Cambodia.},
