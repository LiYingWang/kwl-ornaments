 abstract="The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",

It offers original, exciting approaches to the growing area of research in archaeology and colonialism." "The case studies used range from the pyramids of Old Kingdom {Egypt} to illicit whisky distilling in nineteenth-century {Scotland}, and from the Roman roads of {Turkey} to the threshing floors of {Cyprus} under British colonial rule. Dr. Given uses the archaeological evidence to create a vivid picture of how the lives and identities of farmers, artisans and labourers were affected by colonial systems of oppressive taxation, bureaucracy, forced labour and ideological control.". "This is the first book to integrate fully the archaeological study of the landscape with the concerns of colonial and postcolonial history, theory and scholarship. It will be valuable to anyone investigating the relationship between local community and central control in a wide range of historical and archaeological contexts."--BOOK JACKET.},
