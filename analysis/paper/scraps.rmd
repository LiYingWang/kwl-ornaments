@Berrocal2018 examined both archaeological and historical records of Heping Dao in northern Taiwan. This was the location of the colony of San Salvador founded by the Spanish in 1626 and taken over by the Dutch in 1642. Berrocal et al. uncovered parts of the foundation of a Spanish church and a European cemetery that indicate the evidence of European occupation. These remains indicate a direct impact on the local indigenous populations through their modification of the local landscape. In contrast to Heping Dao, Yilan in Northeastern Taiwan is a physically isolated area adjacent to colonial centres and there are no traces of European settlement but occasional interactions with the Europeans. Yilan, also called "Kavalan" by local indigenous people, is an alluvial plain circumscribed by the Pacific and mountains on the sides. The rugged Hsuehshan Range to the west and Central Range to the south of the Yilan Plain that made it not easily accessible to the European colonists and the colonial control was weaker compared to other parts of this region [@Andrade2007; @Kang2012]. This makes Yilan an especially unique location for exploring indirect colonial effects on local indigenous settlements living beyond the borders of direct colonial occupation.
